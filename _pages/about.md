I am an Associate Research Scientist in Psychiatry with specific training and expertise in cognitive neuroscience and multimodal neuroimaging techniques, including electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). My research focuses on understanding brain development in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders. I aim to identify neural signatures of atypical development and support translational approaches to early intervention.
