I am an Associate Research Scientist in Psychiatry with expertise in cognitive neuroscience and multimodal neuroimaging (EEG, fMRI). My research examines brain development and function in both typically and atypically developing children, adolescents, and adults. I strive to identify neural signatures underlying developmental trajectories and to advance translational approaches to early intervention and treatment, including cognitive training and noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).
