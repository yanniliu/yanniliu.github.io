excerpt: "An enlarged ERN is a neural correlate of adolescent OCD that is associated with age at OCD symptom onset. Adolescents with OCD may have impaired cognitive control on a flanker task. Follow-up studies with larger samples may determine whether an enlarged ERN in adolescents with OCD is associated with a higher risk for MDD."
