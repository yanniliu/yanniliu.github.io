excerpt: "Atypical increase in error-related pMFC activation with age in pediatric OCD suggests altered development of pMFC function during the early course of illness. Greater pMFC activation with better performance in HC, and with age and lower symptom severity in OCD patients, suggests an adaptive function of heightened pMFC response to errors."
