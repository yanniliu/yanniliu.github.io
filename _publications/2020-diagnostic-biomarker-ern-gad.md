excerpt: "The area under the curve (AUC) in the ROC analysis was 0.64, indicating the ERN is an inadequate diagnostic test for AD altogether. The ERN was significantly increased in cases with either GAD or OAD compared to HC. The AUC in ROC analyses with GAD and OAD was 0.75 and 0.56, respectively, suggesting the ERN provides an adequate diagnostic test for GAD but not for OAD."
