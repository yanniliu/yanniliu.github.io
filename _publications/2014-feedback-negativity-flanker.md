excerpt: "A negative deflection in the event-related potential is enhanced following error- and loss-related feedback in decision-making and simple gambling tasks. Researchers have assumed that the perceptual properties of the feedback stimuli are unimportant in explaining these effects. This assumption was tested in the present study through a flanker gambling task, in which the perceptual properties of the feedback were manipulated."
